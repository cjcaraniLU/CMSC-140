Our project creates a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It uses pygame to create a pop up window in which the game will be played in. 

We used pygame to create our game board and draw game pieces as well as lines.

CJ: I created the game board as well as the game pieces. I used pygame to achieve this. Also I created the restart function that restarts the game.

Bryce: I made the functions that dealt with checking the board to see if there is a winner. I made the functions that drew the lines if theres a winner too.

To get our game to work on your computer follow these steps: 

1. Open a new terminal and enter in: python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
  // This will install the pygame module that will help run our Tic-Tac-Toe program.
2. Next just run our program and our Tic-Tac-Toe game will appear!
