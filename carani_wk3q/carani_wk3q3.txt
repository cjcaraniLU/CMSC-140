1. x is 5 at Marker Q1
2. x is 0 at Marker Q2
3. No the variable x is not the same for Marker Q2 compared to Marker Q1. This is because Q2 x is in the function silly_program and has a different scope (local) compared to Q1 which has global scope. 
4. The code will print:
This is my program
0
1
2
2 is my favorite number
0
1
2
2 is my favorite number
5. The only thing that I missed was the "None" that was printed at the end. This is probably becuase we dont return anything in the function yet want to print something once were done.
